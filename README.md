# DNA.GENERATOR_V4 🧬

## 🛰️ MISSION OVERVIEW
DNA.GENERATOR_V4 is a high-security, military-grade art analysis terminal. It extracts stylistic fingerprints from large corpora of artworks using advanced AI protocols. The system is designed to identify the "Artistic DNA" of a creator across six specialized frameworks.

## 🛠️ TECH STACK
- **Frontend**: React 18 (TypeScript) + Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + Framer Motion (CRT/Retro Aesthetic)
- **Backend**: Express.js (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4o (via Replit AI Integrations)

## 🚀 KEY FEATURES
- **Manual Corpus Input**: Analyze up to 30 specific artworks by manual entry.
- **Parallel Extraction**: 6 analysis frameworks processed simultaneously for maximum power.
- **Museum API Monitoring**: Real-time status tracking for MET, AIC, and CMA databases.
- **Archive Generation**: Automated creation of analysis reports and artwork corpus as a downloadable ZIP package.
- **Retro-Terminal UI**: Immersive CRT effect with Matrix-style animations and scanlines.

## 🧬 ANALYSIS PROTOCOLS
1. **DNA ARTISTIQUE**: Core stylistic identity and brushwork.
2. **COMPOSITION**: Structural arrangements and spatial logic.
3. **LUMIÈRE**: Lighting techniques and tonal depth.
4. **COULEURS**: Chromatic palettes and color harmony.
5. **FINITIONS**: Textural details and surface quality.
6. **ICONOGRAPHIE**: Symbolism and thematic recurring motifs.
